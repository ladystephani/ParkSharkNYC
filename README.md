## Description

ParkSharkNYC is an app designed for users who enjoy visiting New York City Parks, enjoying the nature and other features (such as historical monuments), and writing about their visits. 

The app opens to a "planning" page, presenting the user with the option to either press a button that submits their coordinates, or search by zip code. In either case, a function will search through an array of NYC park properties and select all that are within a mile of the search copordinates. 

Once the relevant parks are selected, they are both plotted onto a map, as well as rendered as search results. The user is then able to see the park name, its address, and whether or not it features historical monuments or official trails. From here, the user can plan their next park adventure!

A second page, titled 'Journal', allows the user to log their park experience as a simple journal entry, which gets stored in localStorage. They are able to view all past entries by pressing the "Show Memories" button, which then renders a table that can be sorted either by date or park name.
